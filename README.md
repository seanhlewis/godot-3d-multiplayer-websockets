# Godot Multiplayer Template

This is a template for a 3D multiplayer game developed in Godot Engine 4.3. It provides a basic structure for a multiplayer setup, where each player has a nickname displayed above their character and the option to choose from four different skins: red, green, blue, or yellow.

## How to run the project

Note: To test multiplayer locally, follow these steps:
